# Stripe Samples List

This is a directory of Stripe Samples that are integrated with the [Stripe CLI](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli#stripe-cli). This directory is used by the Stripe CLI to [list](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/wiki/samples-command) and [create](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/wiki/samples-command) samples.

TODO: Anytime a new Stripe Sample repository is added, a GitHub Action automatically updates this directory.
